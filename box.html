        <h2> <font face = "Brush Script Std"> Hi all. As you know i'm Vihaan. I am and 8th grader. Lockdown had me a lot bored and i didn't know what to do
       all day long except studying. So I thought why not try something new after studying. I was watching this tv series
       where they were doing origami as an exam for art. I researched about origami and found a lot of info and now 
       everyday after studying, I sit at my table with some paper and try to make different things. I'm trying to make a zoo with all that I have learnt.
       I hope you learn something from this origami website too. Please do follow me. Thanks :)
