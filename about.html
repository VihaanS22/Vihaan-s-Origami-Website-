    <h1><i><u>Origami and how I learnt it</u></i></h1>
 <h2>  Hi all. As you know i'm Vihaan. I am and 8th grader. Lockdown had me a lot bored and i didn't know what to do
all day long except studying. So I thought why not try something new after studying. I was watching this tv series
where they were doing origami as an exam for art. I researched about origami and found a lot of info and now 
everyday after studying, I sit at my table with some paper and try to make different things. I'm trying to make a zoo with all that I have learnt.
I hope you learn something from this origami website too. Please do follow me. Thanks :)
